CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package):
  Found package configuration file:

    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt6/Qt6Config.cmake

  but it set Qt6_FOUND to FALSE so package "Qt6" is considered to be NOT
  FOUND.  Reason given by package:

  Failed to find required Qt component "Core".

  Expected Config file at
  "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt6Core/Qt6CoreConfig.cmake" exists

  

  Configuring with -DCMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE=TRUE might reveal details why the
  package was not found.

  Configuring with -DQT_DEBUG_FIND_PACKAGE=ON will print the values of some
  of the path variables that find_package uses to try and find the package.
